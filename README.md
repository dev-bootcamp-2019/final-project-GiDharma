### A very SIMPLE Bounty System


I've chosen to implement the Bounty System Idea.

##### Fulfilled requirements:

* At least usage of one library or module from EthPM (I've encountered problems using EthPM, I included it as an inline contract) - Owned
* Implementation of circuit breaker as a part of the Bounty contract
* 5 Tests for each contract

__Note__: Due to lack of time cause of unfortunate events, this project is far from being near completion. I apologize for the inconvinience.


##### The project is a truffle drizzle unboxed, Bounty contract is a instance contract not a singleton, thus needs to be made
##### I haven't had the chance to complete the UI, hence it does not work
